Let's see if our users meet all the criteria for entrance to a hot new restaurant.

## Introduction
Boston just opened a hot new 21+ restaurant in the Downtown Crossing area. We've been tasked to to build a program that will greet an interested party, determine if there's room for the party members, and ensure that all members are of age and dressed appropriately. Let's get started!

### Using Conditionals

As you satisfy the acceptance criteria, log your work to the browser console. Don't be afraid
to use your Google skillz and look at prior articles to figure out how to assess input!

• As a user, I should be greeted by the program at the door.  

• The program prompts a user to enter the number of members in their party.  

• If the user enters invalid input (anything not a number) re-prompt them.

• If the party is equal to or less than 8, the program moves on. If not, the program alerts the user it's too busy to let them in, and the program ends.  

• If the party is equal to or less than 8, the program asks if all members are equal to or over 21 years of age. If yes, the program moves on. If no, the program alerts the party that all members must be over 21 and the program ends.  

• If the user enters invalid input (anything not a number) re-prompt them.

•If all members are over 21, the program prompts the user to confirm all members have a valid ID with them. If all do, the program moves on. If they do not, the program alerts the party that all members must have a valid ID, and the program ends.

• If the user enters invalid input (anything not 'yes' or 'no') re-prompt them.  

• If all members have a valid ID, the program confirms no one is wearing jeans, and welcomes them in. If someone is wearing jeans, the program alerts them there's a dress code, and the program ends.  

• If the user enters invalid input (anything not 'yes' or 'no') re-prompt them.
