Practice working with arrays in JavaScript!

## Getting Started
```no-highlight
et get js-array-drills-2
cd js-array-drills-2
code .
open index.html
```

>Your work should go in the `main.js` file

### Instructions

In the `main.js` file, some data and code have been provided.  Follow along with the comments and use the `filter`, `find`, and `reduce` methods to solve the problems! **Don't forget to use `console.log` so your results print to the console!

**The article JavaScript Filter, Find, Reduce will be immensely helpful.**

* `Filter` the members of the Company of the Ring whose names begin with "G"

* `Filter` the members of the Company of the Ring that are hobbits

* Use the `find` method to return the one ring bearer

* Use `reduce` to calculate the cumulative strength of the party!
