## Instructions
This assignment is divided into *core challenges* and *optional challenges*. Focus on the core challenges first and make sure you have a firm grasp on those examples.  

**Tip:** Open up the corresponding test files in the `js/spec/core` folder to view test cases and expectations to guide your development.

##### Core Challenge

* Files are located in `js/src/core`.
* Implement the functions in `arrays.js`, `objects.js`, and `strings.js`.

##### Optional Challenge
* To work on the optional challenges, first uncomment out the `js/spec/optional` files and then refresh your browser to get the failing tests.
* Files are located in `js/src/optional`.
* Implement the functions in `functions.js` and `recursion.js`
